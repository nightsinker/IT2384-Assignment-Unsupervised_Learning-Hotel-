The hotel is connected to the MRT (train) system which is really handy for daytime travel. The restaurants in velocity mall, a few steps from the hotel entrance, are also good and cheap for lunch/early dinner or tea.

It is about a 10-15 minutes drive to parts of the CBD and located in the hospital district which has absolutely no nightlife. I would reccommend staying closer to the city centre if you like to party at night. Perfect for those who will use the MRT only and not go out a night.

The view from top to the pool and the surroundings was spectacular. The library is a nice place to relax, read, and tea. They provide compliment refreshments. I love the dessert like creme brûlée, homemade cookies and chocolates, fruits and the beverage bar with quality tea bags. The best thing is that you will never need to show your key card except to open the gym room door. The lighting and air-con can be adjusted with a high tech digital panel near the bed. The pool is the best place for photos. And when we were swimming on a sunny day. A staff gave each of us one choc ice-cream ball coated with chocolate! Really delicious and so sweet of him. We haven't had a drink at the bar but the environment is nice especially at night. It is spacious. We saw a male peacock at the garden on the floor where the lobby situates. I love the room. A double bed plus a couch large enough for 2 ppl. The bathroom looks neat and I especially like the white round chair where you can relaxingly sit on to blow your hair or makeup. The only disadvantage is the location. It is not close from the closest Sentosa Express Imbiah Station. We walked for 20 minutes from it to the hotel when we didn't take cab.

We stayed in a shophouse room with club lounge access. The Pros: - The hotel itself has got a great historic/colonial feel to it. They have kept the design cues which make it feel luxurious yet full of character - The club lounge continues this warm, interesting design & feel. The service & food in the lounge is great so well worth upgrading if you can - Our room was comfortable & well appointed - The overall service in this hotel was great & consistent. If we had a request, the staff tried their best to accommodate - Check in was quick and friendly. (We checked in at the club lounge) - Location was good, with lots of markets, shops, etc near by. The Cons: - There's only one small negative comment which is to do with the shophouse rooms. Although the room itself was good & I understand the reasoning (these were originally the shophouses back in the day) it just didn't feel as luxurious being on the 3rd floor of the hotel with no real views out our window. Personally I would prefer to be up on a high floor. Also, to get to the shophouse rooms there is 2 ways - the long way which involves a significant walk around the hotel, or the short way up a flight of un-airconditioned stairs. Either way is not ideal especially since the main hallway to the shophouse rooms is technically outside (under cover but no aircon) which is not comfortable with the Singapore humidity which can be quite unbearable at times.

But during my check in, we were told that they have ran out of baby cots & only left with twin beds for non-smoking rooms. The next option offered is to take a smoking room which has a King size bed. As I need a King size bed so that the baby could sleep between us (since we couldn't get a cot), we took the risk & opted for the smoking room. The desk officer told us we can call room service & get a air purifier. Luckily, the room don't stink with cigarettes. The check in was slow & took us 15 mins though we were second in line. There isn't any clear instruction on where to queue & we can see that some guests were actually confused when the check in crowd came at 3.15pm. The room was surprisingly spacious & big. We have stayed in another RWS hotel. The deluxe room at Equarius is almost three times the size of that. The room was comfortable & looks clean. But I had a shock to see a baby lizard in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows are rather high & firm. We took quite a while to get used & fall asleep. The pools are quiet & I think more suitable for Couples on honeymoon than for families with young children. Thus, we took the hotel shutter bus to Hard Rock hotel instead for their pool. Though it was weekend, we didn't have problem getting onto the buses with our baby & her stroller. The shutter bus goes to other parts of RWS too where we settled our meals & visited the SEA Aquarium. Equarius would be a good choice if you are looking for spacious & comfortable rooms.

The bed was small, but very comfortable. The seatee was huge and comfortable, too. There was TV in the bathroom for those who wanted a bubble bath. The only downside is the coffee/tea making facility. For that kind of price, we would expect a coffee machine, and not just a kettle with 3-in-1 sachets. The service was awful. We arrived at the lobby to find the Front Desk unmanned. We asked a staff who went to the Front Desk to get something, only to be told that she was not from Front Desk. She just walked off without helping us get the FOA. It was a good 5 minutes before an FOA went to the desk (again, to get something!) and we asked for help. She called her colleague from inside the office to assist us, and we had to roll our eyes again. This FOA wore costume bracelets that extended from her elbow to her wrists. She was probably the most poorly groomed hotel FOA we have ever seen (and we have stayed in many, many hotels before, from boutique to invitation-only hotels).

We arrived the hotel at 10am and when we checked in, the receptionist offered a promo of room upgrade, late check out, free breakfast for two, and free unlimited use of its club lounge with snacks, drinks and cocktails. At an affordable price, we took the promo offer. He gave us the key card after we checked in even if their check in time is at 2pm. The room is not small but big enough for a Couples. It is complete with safety box, a fridge with snacks, nice beddings with pillows. The bathroom is organized, complete with toiletries (FCUK), and what I liked most is its heated toilet bowl with wash controls. We were given the privelege to use the Club Lounge at the 11th floor. The lounge has stocks of refillable snacks and fruits, canned sodas and brewed coffee. Wifi in the room and around the hotel is free and unlimited. Service staff are excellent.

BIG NO NO - The Chinese restaurant (Min Jiang) has a full page of shark's fin soup options, which was not advertised until we sat down and read the menu... and then stood up and walked out again. Even Hong Kong restaurants have stopped selling this barbaric dish. The steak restaurant (our back-up that evening) was nice enough, some of the staff were excellent but one in particular and taken one too many energy drinks (or something) to get him through his shift and was overly energetic and annoying, and I suggest going for the steaks as they were simple, well cooked and delicious whereas the chicken was literally dying under a torrent of fois gras and truffle.

I expect Internet to be included, specifically when you pay close to 200 USD per room/night. Moreover, the room was not really made up properly on the second day: bed was ok, but the large pillows were left on the work desk, along with other garbage (candy wrapping paper, plastic bags).

On the last night there was neither gin or lemon and it was suggested to me I might like a vodka instead!! I suggested someone go next door to the 7/11 and buy a bottle. Needless to say whilst waiting for the general manager's explanation a bottle of gin was found (with lemon) after about 40 minutes.

Large rooms and highly accessible, the hotel boasts modern facilities without losing its colonial influence that characterizes the hotel. This time round, we booked the Junior Suite. The 50sqft room featured a living room and a bedroom that was segregated with a sliding door. Picture how the Dutch would design the interior of the living room - a set of sofa with lamp-tables on the side, round marble table accompanied with Victorian-like chairs, a huge cabinet and an ancient-looking fan perched on the ceiling. But the room was nothing short of modernity - flat-screen TV sat in the cabinet with Nespresso Coffee Machine and fridges resided below it. Mirrors and artistic lamps are also used to enhance the feel of modernism of the room. The bedroom was large; the bed was comfortable; and there were two cupboards - one for the gent and one for the lady. The bathroom, however, was tiny as compared to the impressive living-room and bedroom. Since the room was probably designed decades ago, the bathroom only housed a bathtub, making showering a messy business with water dripping out of the tub. We were also greeted with a grinding noise from the bathroom ceiling every morning that lasted for a few minutes. Despite these short-comings, we were still satisfied with the hotel. Service staff was attentive and friendly. Bus stop that brings you to the major malls across the Orchard shopping belt was 7 minutes away. Orchard MRT that brings you to many other exciting places in Singapore was 10 minutes away. And the food was yummylicious as always, although they were pretty pricey.

Room This is the great point for the hotel. I booked for Deluxe Room and I got a HUGE room (It is difficult to find a huge room like this in Singapore). It about 50 sqm. My baby loved crawling over the carpeted room. I got King Size Bed. They also provided double queen size bed for the twin deluxe room. You also can have microwave in the room (plus point). The bathroom is quite big with bathtub and shower. They also have connected room between king size & double queen room. Breakfast Decent breakfast with limited menu (maybe because I order via Travel Agent, I got different breakfast than others) :( Service The service is very good. At the first, I got dissapointed because they give double queen room instead of king room. It takes about 15 mins to change the card key. But the bell boy was very friendly & cheerful to make me more patient. I also enjoy the hospitality of the room service aunty on the 11th floor. She always smiled in the morning when take my laundry bag. And the most important thing, the recepsionist manager upgraded my parents room from superior to double queen size room. So, we have side by side room. We really grateful. Thank you sir! Overall, I recommended this hotel for your stay in Singapore. For a 3 star hotel, it is very worthy. Actually, this hotel is a language training center. So you can find a lot of students in this hotel. But it is not an annoyance at all.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

There was basically a slight error in the hotel booking which accidentally had my uncles name instead of mine even though it was my own booking. I tried to explain the situation and even offered to show her proof of my payment and details but she was initially unable to get her head around the simple circumstances and not willing to let me check in, keeping me waiting as she tapped behind her computer for a long time without explaining what was going on. she was incompetent and rude to the point that when I was trying to reach out for my phone from her, she yanked her hand away from me and finally dropped my phone down on the counter instead of handing it back to me as she was unhappy with the situation I am guessing. Finally she asked if I wanted twin beds or a double bed, even though I was clearly staying with my other half and had stated on my agoda booking that I wanted a double bed. She then asked me if I wanted a smoking or non smoking room, again something which I had already stated in my booking - non smoking. She finally gave us a room and when we entered there was a strong stale smell of cigarette smoke and an ashtray. I immediately called front desk to clarify this and found out that the fifth floor was only very recently changed to ""non smoking"" but as it had always been a ""smoking"" level previously, the smell of cigarette smoke was inevitable. I enquired if the hotel was fully booked hence the last resort of this room and they said no, they had several other rooms and offered to change this for me immediately. Although rest of my stay was pleasant, this first impression and hassle got it off to a bad start.

34740,5715,Solo travelers,6.0,Australia,Oceania,7.3,"Nice stay here overall, but a bit overpriced for what you got. Pros: - Quietish (in terms of other people using it) pool area with spa and gym (except for the construction noise - see below). A pool is really important in such a humid, hot climate. - A newspaper was left outside the door each day. - Fast lifts. - Great location at the end of Orchard Road, close to Bras Basah as well as Dhoby Ghaut stations (Dhoby Ghaut has 3 lines coming off it). One of Singapore's many great (cheap!) food courts, Kopitiam, is right around the corner and it's open 24 hours and air conditioned. Also the City Sightseeing bus stops right outside the hotel. - A special request for a big bed via agoda.com was met with no problem. - Super early checkout (at around 6am due to an early flight) was also no issue. Cons: - The room smelled a bit musty and the bedlinen felt slightly damp from the airconditioning. - There were lots of construction works going on around the hotel (I think building a new MRT station, with an estimated completion date of 2017), so there was a fair amount of noise til fairly late at night. - There was nowhere to plug in a hair straightener near a mirror (really annoying! #firstworldproblems) - Very limited number of TV channels available, mostly news channels. - On check in they ask for a credit card, which is normal, but for me with only a debit card I had to give S$100 in cash for security. No problem getting this back when I left, but now I have to change this money back into something I can use at home. I would recommend this hotel overall for its central location. It feels like it's in the centre of all the action. Also love the cheap eating options nearby.

The overall experience turns out to be disappointing and we quickly got the impression that all the additional service we get for the Club membership was nothing more than a package put together by the marketing team to boost the hotel ratings, rather than a genuine effort to make travellers feel at home. Quality of breakfast meal was sub standard and we ended up trying to find a local restaurant outside to get breakfast. The Club lounge supposedly offers free drinks but I discovered that free drinks are only available around 6-8pm. If you’re on vacation in Singapore, who stays at the hotel at 6-8pm? This is not a resort hotel we’re talking about. The Club-only area on the 20th floor sounds great at first, but it was simply a replacement for a lobby area that Oasia doesn’t have. And they made you pay to have access for that “lobby” area. $20 to play one movie at the hotel room? What a joke. Overall we didn’t feel that the staff made a real effort to be hospitable and helpful in a genuine way. They were always smiling, but when we asked them if they could help us get a carton box for packing our stuff, the answer was a quick no. Also when I went to the Concierge to get a package that has been left there by a friend, he was unable to find the package and instead tried to put the burden of proof on me -- the guest -- to proof to him that someone really did leave a package for me. We were also trying to pack stuff into a box and not only was there no offer to help, but every request for a packing tape was responded in with a forced attitude.

Just be aggressive about talking to the staff outside about being a hotel guest and you should get through the queue faster.

The shower/bathroom was modern looking but not very functional. Shower pressure is way too weak and the area was covered only half way so water gets everywhere. It can be very messy and dengerous. Other family members stayed at a delux room for less, but seems like there was no difference in terms of the room and amenities.

This is not a last minute thing, why can't I get the bed I wanted? My first visit wasn't a problem. Or is this just bias just because I'm a local? When ask if I insist on a room with king bed, was told that it's a smoking room which I really don't mind but I need to wait.

Lifts were extremely slow, always (except for 2 occasions) at the wrong end. Even though I asked for high floor, despite that I had to ask to change the room. The worst issue was that I had asked and arranged before arrival and at check-in time for late checkout and to pay half-day charge. However, despite prior arrangements, on the day of checking out, I was charged half-day as ""walk-in rate"" which ended up to be as much as the rate for one night extra. So, better off just to have paid an extra night and have more flexibility.

Upon check in, i encountered the first hotel that only accepted credit cards for their security deposit, as we never did bring our credit cards out for a night stay, other options too were shot down, such as cash or even debit cards. We spend the next five mins trying to come out with a solution, only to have the receptionist telling us that it was ok. We requested for a late check out at 1 pm which i'll get back to. Housekeeping was of no use as it seemed like when we asked for things at the receptionist, they could just tell us to wait and they gave it to us to bring it up ourselves. We entered our room and immediately, i felt like i was in a better maintained version of a budget hotel. Everything including the wall papers and toilet screamed out budget, the toilet had no doors, which basically wet the whole floor, the walls were so thin that i could hear each time someone came by or was closing their doors or anything. It was really unpleasant, which we opt to be out of the hotel more than being in it. The next day, as we were still sound asleep at 10ish, knowing our check out was at 1pm, my partner was rudely awaken by a receptionist, in which i took over the phone half awake who told us that check out was at 12pm, when i told her, we were given the late check out, throughout the entire time in her robotic voice, she insisted that hotel policy was 12 and the whole card system thing. I told her off and when i believed she saw the late check out memo, she backed off by saying that we had to leave by 1. Overall the room was small, toilet was small and crappily touched up, we quickly checked ourselves out.

I made the grave mistake of booking the hotel without looking through all the reviews and found out afterwards that all the negative reviews turned out to be true. The hotel staff is unprofessional and unpleasant to speak with. We were charged twice on the first night at the Spice Brasserie – when I tried to explain that a member of my dining party would like to pay with her UOB credit card, and asked the staff member to cancel the charge to the room, she was very unhappy, said it could not be done, and complain that I had messed up her system! Every morning, we had to wait about 20 minutes to get down to the lobby and the stairway was a fire hazard strewn with old furniture and trash. When I checked in, I was given the key to a room that was already occupied – I found out afterwards that this isn’t the first time it has happened! During our 9 day stay, we spent the first four days waiting around for room change first due to noisy neighbors, then due to a stale, mildewed room that made me ill after 2 nights. When we asked to pay the difference to move to the club floor, we were rudely told us, “Do you know we are fully booked; there are no more rooms” When I asked to speak with the manager, I was told “ Today is holiday you know – he does not work on a holiday!” I do not recommend this hotel to anyone who want a pleasant vacation – there are much better places in Singapore for the same or better price.

49689,3167,Solo travelers,6.0,United States of America,North America,7.7,"Overall, I enjoyed the hotel. I was told by a family member that the large company he worked for put up some of their best clients here. And sure enough, most of my expectations were met. The design of the building was like an older club building, but the inside has been renovated and is quite delightful. I enjoyed the two pools, and it has a passable fitness center. I especially liked the service and getting wake up calls at the right time is important. The front desk even followed that up with a personal call to the room. Also they were spot on as far as reserving early morning cabs. The Chinese restaurant and even the more general café had excellent food, but was very pricy. Even the continental breakfast was 28 Sing dollars, the buffet, more than 35 sing dollars. I recommend ordering off the menu. I was able to get my eggs,bacon and toast with juice- all that I needed for $16 sing dollars. They cleaned the room each day and brought up an ironing board and iron when I requested. In the US, most rooms come equipped with one, but I only needed once. The big issue I had was finding a working electrical outlet in my room. There was only one in the bedroom, and I could plug my I phone into another in the bathroom. I found two others, which were on two different sides of the closet inside. A little like hide and go seek. Overall, the dim sum restaurant was one of the best I have experienced at a hotel. I visited it twice, and it was worth the splurge. I also had Peking Duck there, and it was great. I recommend the hotel as a great place to stay, especially with the pool.

Taxi driver from airport did same thing. Asked lady who called cab over how much should it cost to go to my hotel. She say about $20sd, I say ok. Taxi Driver at arrival said $45sd.
